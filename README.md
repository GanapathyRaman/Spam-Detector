# Spam-Detector
The project is about developing and implementing an algorithm which can classify the mails as a spam or a ham. Given a set of mails which contains both ham mails and spam mails, when this set of mails are passed as the input to the detector program the detector program classifies the each mail either as a spam or ham based on the algorithm (set of conditions). In phase 1, a rule based spam detector was developed, which classifies the mail either as spam or non-spam based on certain rules. A well-know 250 blacklisted words which frequently occur in spam mails are collected and stored in a bag-of-words. The detector program check if the email contains any of these black-listed word in it. If the mail has black-listed word(s), then the mail is marked as spam mail, else the mail is marked as ham mail. In phase 2, a spam detector program was developed which classifies a mail as a spam or a ham not just based on the occurrence of the black-listed words. Because the black-listed words can also occur in ham mails. To overcome this drawback, a new algorithm which follows Na√Øve Bayes classification method was implemented. Initially the detector is trained with a sample set of mails which contains both spam and ham mails. Also each time when the word repeats the number of occurrence of that word is incremented by count one. Finally, two list (one for spam words and other for ham words) along with occurrence count of the words are stored in two hash list (dictionary).
